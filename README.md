Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dankags/medical-consultation-system.git

```

**Installation**

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

**Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following content:


```bash

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project.


## Learn More

To learn more about the technologies used, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/docs) which i used for authetication and API route and pages routes protection.
- [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next) - i used shadcn which is a rich UI library which makes development much faster.
- [Mpesa](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/) - Since the project is centraled more on `Kenya` i used mpesa to make transaction like deposit for `users` and withdraws for `doctors`.
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) - I used it to test the mpesa APIs in development mode since it does not support http.
- [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs) - i used twilio which support `sms` which i used to notify patients if there were any new appointments.
- [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) - this is the web app memory or database for both files and documents.
- [SocketIO](https://socket.io/docs/v4/) - patients are able to send live booking request to online doctors and also notification.
- [LiveKit](https://livekit.io/use-cases/video-conferencing) - This is an open source kit with many features like `Video Confrencing`, `Video Streaming` and `Voice agent` that you can intergrate with your app to have the above features.
- [Email.js](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/examples/reactjs/) - i used this in order to send email between the doctors and patients.

## Deployment

For deployment we could have used [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

But since vercel does not support socket server you could use alternatives like [render](https://render.com/) as your choice or you could search online for deployment platforms that support socket serve.

Check out our example [Example](https://medical-consultation-system.onrender.com)
