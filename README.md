This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Before doing anything ensure you have this keys in your .env.local or .env file if not get them  from [AppWrite](https://appwrite.io/)

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/auth/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/auth/sign-up
PROJECT_ID=
DATABASE_ID=
API_KEY=
PATIENT_COLLECTION_ID=
USER_COLLECTION_ID=
PAYMENT_COLLECTION_ID=
DOCTOR_COLLECTION_ID=
APPOINTMENT_COLLECTION_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUCKET_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=    #http://localhost:3000 for development or your domain in production
PORT=3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSKEY=1111
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL=
RESEND_API_KEY=

```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
